/// warning | DISCLAIMER
_The technical side of the BnB strategy in the last abyss, you can see
here_[:fontawesome-brands-reddit:{.reddit}][strategy].  
Initially, I did not plan to make a post about BnB, but after taking the top 1, interest in the topic was inevitable.  
It is important to understand that a victorious BnB strategy itself and its successful realization is not an accident or
a gift of
heaven, but a natural consequence of the great work done. The fundamental part of which is the building
an active and motivated community that the leaders of the "blacks" managed to create.  
In this post I will try, as briefly as possible, to analyze what the BnB community is based on and how it differs
from what can be seen in the RU community (in my humble experience).

Due to internal regulations, I do not have the right to disclose some of the nuances of the guild organization and this
post
will only be made public after prior review by BNB leaders for sensitive information.  
Please be understanding.

## Intro

When I left the "No Mercy", the curious were interested, why BnB, NM is the top of RU community?  
But that's why I left, I wanted to look at a fundamentally different community.  
Then some reassure:
> There all the same!  
> It's just that the whales are fatter!  
> What do you think you'll find there?

Well, after the abyss, it's time to share my experience and impressions.  
And about what I was looking for and what I found.

## Worlds Ranked #1

Currently BnB #1 in the **world**.  
For the first time, the [realms](../kb/realms.md) Grand Prix was taken by a non-Chinese.  
KLBR were breathing in the back, the calculations were so verified that just one sleepy guildmate could ruin the first
place.  
But the system built in BnB did it!  
A lot of human labor has been invested in this victory, for the most part certainly from the leaders and all those
involved in
organizational activities.  
These are people who have many outstanding human qualities, among which I would like to highlight:

- Motivation and ability to count.
- Attention to detail.
- Organization and coordination.

The three pillars behind BnB success

## What is BNB?

In fact, BNB is a closed community of highly motivated people whose main goal is
maximizing the potential of player accounts, which will logically affect the results of AbEx as well. (But only
kind of!)

## Discord

When you first get into the "black" discord, a truly incredible amount of content opens up to your eyes.
In BnB, there is some prohibitive number of channels dedicated directly to the game itself, there are 50+ of them, but
with all this they
very well categorized.
If you add here the ability to use channel mutes, then there are no problems with navigation.
Guiding advice from jono:

![desc][discodesc]

For clarity, you can compare with the ru community  
![comp2][discodetails]

As for the other 350 channels, the BNB discord is designed so that a person who gets into it can find here not only
answers to any question about the game, but also a place where you can comfortably spend your leisure time and chat /
share any aspect of your interests.

Everything is done here so that each participant would be as comfortable as possible within the community.
By the way, there are no strict rules in any form, this function is perfectly performed by a section with a description
of all the channels available on the server, clearly defined topics and expected content.

As you may have noticed, a separate discord server with a comparable number of channels is used for the abyss.
At first I assumed that the main purpose of such a decision was to once again emphasize the importance of the event, but
when I saw the total number of channels, it became obvious that placing all this on one server would be hell for any
manager (who has access to all / most of these channels).
But even despite the initial reasons for such a decision, this does not detract from the positive bonus indicated
above + opportunities open up for organizing / distributing key coordinators specifically for the abyss and easy
management of role-based access, without the need to embed them in the role model of the main community server.

## Organizational structure

Pay attention to the article on reddit, Compo's final words:
> Shout out to all of leadership at BnB for your hard work, coordinating 193 people in a mobile game for two weeks isn't
> an easy task!

**193** is the exact number of _active_ BNB players in the abyss, just wonder what it's like to coordinate 193 people?
If
transfer to army terminology, then the guild (70 people) is considered [company][rota] soldier, and 193 is the maximum
size
companies. And it takes at least 5 people to manage that many people.
people (and this is not counting the commanders of the platoons and squads of which the company consists).
But the analogy with the army is not appropriate, and in the case of BnB in particular, because the mobile gacha has
games and an army
there is no common and cannot be:

![nat][national]{align=right width=320}

1. There is no threat/enemy here
2. There are no clearly regulated statutory relations
3. The personnel, taken separately, formations in the army, for natural reasons, are characterized by:

- One age group
- Homogeneous social and civil status

To mention fact that BnB has a very diverse composition on a national basis.  
How non-trivial can be the coordination of people, where everyone is free to do as he sees fit, for many
English is not a native language, and some do not know it at all?  
Although the analogy is not appropriate, in BNB the approach to the abyss is extremely serious and the organizational
structure of the coordinators includes more than two levels of coordinators and, to some extent, follows the canons of
military craft.  
Well, now it clearly showed effectiveness.  
I take my hat off to the creators.

## Instead of a conclusion

Even before BNB, it was in principle obvious to me that for a good result in the abyss (and not only), the main thing is
**people**, not accounts (wallet). And here it is felt especially clearly.  
And this victory was achieved precisely by **people**.  
Tests, calculating the minimum required relics to kill the boss, **coordinating** so many motley people.  
These are all merit of human genius.
And BNB understands this very well and therefore creates all conditions for **for the comfort of people**.
Of course, the strength of accounts plays a role, an important one, but for BNB this question is out of scope.
Because when you have such a strong community, **motivated** people are naturally drawn to you.
